      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming
        language that is primarily used for client-side scripting on the web but
        it could be used for server-side applications too. It is the foundation
        of frontend web development and is essential for creating interactive
        web pages, web applications, and mobile applications. With frameworks
        like Node.js, React, and Angular, JavaScript has evolved from being a
        simple scripting language to one of the most in-demand technologies
        across the web development world.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>2. What is JavaScript ?</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily
        used for creating dynamic and interactive content on the web. It was
        created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape.
        Initially developed in just 10 days, JavaScript has grown into a
        powerful and popular tool for building modern web applications.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>3. Key Features of JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Dynamic Typing:</b> This language is dynamically typed, meaning
          variable types are determined at runtime, and not at compile time.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Prototype-Based Object-Oriented Programming: </b> This language
          uses prototypes to implement inheritance and polymorphism, allowing
          for more flexible and dynamic object creation.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>First-Class Functions: </b>Functions are treated as first-class
          citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions,
          returned as values from functions, and stored in data structures.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Event-Driven Programming: </b>JavaScript allows you to respond to
          user actions (like clicks or keystrokes) via event listeners, making
          it perfect for interactive web applications.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Cross-Platform Programming: </b>JavaScript can run on multiple
          platforms, including web browsers, mobile devices, and desktop
          applications, due to its lightweight and interpreted nature.
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Client-Side vs. Server-Side JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript was initially designed to run in the browser, making it a
        client-side scripting language that manipulates the DOM (Document Object
        Model), responds to events, and makes websites interactive. Over time,
        with the advent of Node.js, it expanded to the server-side, where it
        powers back-end logic and handles database interactions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Client-Side: </b>Runs in the browser and handles user interface
          updates, form validations, and dynamic content rendering.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Server-Side (Node.js):</b> Executes on the server to build APIs,
          interact with databases, and manage server-side logic.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h2>5. Core Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Variables and Data Types: </b>JavaScript supports various data
          types such as numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, and
          functions. You can declare variables using var, let, and const.
        </li>
        <br />
        <div class="example">
          <p>let number = 42; // Number</p>
          <p>const name = "JavaScript"; // String</p>
          <p>let isLearning = true; // Boolean</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Functions and Scopes: </b>JavaScript functions allow for modular
          code and can either be declared or written as arrow functions. Scope
          determines the accessibility of variables, and JavaScript has function
          scope and block scope.
        </li>
        <br />
        <div class="example">
          <p>// Function Declaration</p>
          <p>function add(a, b) {</p>
          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;return a + b;</p>
          <p>}</p>
          <p>// Arrow Function</p>
          <p>const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Object and Arrays: </b>Objects store data as key-value pairs, while
          arrays are used to store ordered lists of data.
        </li>
        <br />
        <div class="example">
          <p>//Object</p>
          <p>const car = {brand: "Tesla", model: "Model 3"};</p>
          <p>// Array</p>
          <p>const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Popular Frameworks and Libraries</h2>
      JavaScript's popularity has spawned a wide range of frameworks and
      libraries to simplify development:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>React: </b>A library for building user interfaces, primarily
          maintained by Facebook.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Vue.js :</b>A progressive framework for building modern web
          interfaces.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Angular: </b> A full-fledged framework maintained by Google,
          designed for building large-scale applications.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Node.js: </b> A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be
          run on the server side, making it ideal for building APIs and handling
          back-end logic.
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Comparison with Other Languages</h2>
      <h4>JavaScript vs Python:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>JavaScript </b>is primarily used for web development, while
          <b>Python</b> excels in scientific computing, machine learning, and
          data analysis.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Syntax: </b>JavaScript uses curly braces {} and semicolons ; , while
          Python emphasizes readability with indentation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>JavaScript vs PHP:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>JavaScript </b> is increasingly used in full-stack development with
          Node.js, whereas <b>PHP</b> is traditionally used for server-side
          scripting.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Community: </b>Both languages have a large and active community,
          but JavaScript tends to have more modern frameworks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h2>8. Real-world Applications of JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is the backbone of many popular applications and websites.
        Some notable examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Google Forms Validation: </b>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Function: </b> Ensures that users enter valid data by showing error messages when input in incorrect.</li>
            <img id="gforms" src="Screenshot 2024-10-21 171825.png">
            <li><b>Technology: </b>Client-side Javascript.</li> 
            <li><b>Example of JavaScript code that handle form validaiton</b></li>
            <div class="ex">
              <img id="gforms" src="Screenshot 2024-10-21 172357.png">
              <img id="gforms" src="Screenshot 2024-10-21 172404.png">
            </div>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
      </ul>
      <p>
        JavaScript's versatility extends beyond web development into
        <b>mobile apps</b> (React Native), <b>desktop apps</b> (Electron), and
        even <b>game development</b> (with libraries like Phaser.js).
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, JavaScript has become an essential tool in web
        development, evolving from a simple browser scripting language to a
        versatile, full-stack technology. Its adaptability and ever-growing
        ecosystem make it an essential language for both beginners and
        experienced developers. Whether you're building a dynamic website,
        mobile app, or server-side API, JavaScript has the tools you need to
        succeed in todayâ€™s digital world.
